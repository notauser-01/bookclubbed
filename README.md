# Project 1

Quarantime Book clubbed is all about clubbing the books back with reviews and ratings:

application.py: 
our main flask application with all the ifs, routes, and functions necessary to make the website go. there's comments everywhere, please read them, have a laugh.

import.py:
was used to create tables locally and online. 

fun facts: 
 - nobody wants to document every single file from this project
 - there's no security so don't give it any real information
 - pseudorandom numbers instead of storing session data
 - if you get a username wrong on the login page it'll register a new user with that name
 - the goodreads api returns a 404 error for many of the isbns in the provided table of books
 - this was homework for practice, not project for real. enjoy it, laugh about it, but do not under any circumstances take it too seriously
